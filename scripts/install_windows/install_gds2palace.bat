REM install_gds2palace.bat - one-shot Windows setup for the gds2palace/setupEM
REM workflow.
REM
REM This is a THIN STUB: it only checks that Python is present (and downloads
REM its Python companion, install_gds2palace.py, if that isn't already sitting
REM next to it), then hands everything else off there. See install_gds2palace.py
REM for what this actually does, all the options (--venv-dir, --scripts-dir,
REM --skip-palace, --with-klayout, --yes, --help, ...), and the no-options
REM interactive wizard - run "install_gds2palace.bat --help" to see them.
REM
REM Why the logic lives in Python and not here: an earlier all-batch version
REM of this script kept hitting genuinely arcane cmd.exe parser bugs (paren
REM balance mattering even in code that never runs, "set VAR=" with an empty
REM value silently UNSETTING the variable instead of emptying it, "exit /b"
REM losing its exit code several parenthesized blocks deep, ...) that don't
REM exist in Python, which is already a hard requirement for this workflow
REM anyway. This stub only does the two things that were never actually
REM buggy in the old version: checking Python exists, and one curl download.
