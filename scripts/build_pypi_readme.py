# Build a short PyPI package-page README instead of dumping the full,
# screenshot-heavy repo README.md into the long_description: title + intro
# (reused verbatim from README.md) + install line + a link to GitHub for full
# docs + the last few dated entries from doc/CHANGES.md, so PyPI visitors can
# see what actually changed without digging through the whole README. Writes
# README_pypi.md at repo root, which pyproject.toml's readme= key points at.
# Regenerate before every build.
