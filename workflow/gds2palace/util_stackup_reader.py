# Read XML file with SG13G2 stackup

# File history: 
# Initial version 20 Nov 2024  Volker Muehlhaus 
# Added support for sheet resistance 07 Oct 2025 Volker Muehlhaus 
# Added docstrings 
# 20 Nov 2025: added functionality to get relative positions between metals
# 10 Aug 2026: added derived layer option
# 10 Aug 2026: added Oversize option for derived layers (grow/shrink outline)
# 15 Aug 2026: added Reference/ReferenceEdge option for reference-relative Layer positioning
# 15 Aug 2026: added Reference/ReferenceEdge option for reference-relative Dielectric positioning
# 15 Aug 2026: fixed register_metals_inside() to register a metal by its zmin alone, so a
#              metal whose zmax overflows past its own dielectric (e.g. via Reference) is
#              still registered somewhere instead of silently dropped from metals_inside
# 15 Aug 2026: added a schemaVersion check - prints a warning (does not abort) when a
#              stackup file declares a schemaVersion newer than SUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION
# 16 Aug 2026: fixed register_metals_inside() to compare zmin/zmax with a small epsilon
#              tolerance, so floating-point noise between two independently-accumulated
#              z values that represent the same physical boundary can no longer misassign
#              a boundary-sitting metal (zero real overlap) to the dielectric below it
# 18 Aug 2026: added <Variables>/<Variable> and "="-prefixed expression support, usable in
#              any attribute value anywhere in the file (Materials, Dielectrics, Layers,
#              Substrate, DerivedLayers, Tables) - see doc/XML_stackup_format section
#              "<Variables>"; bumped schema to "3.1"
# 18 Aug 2026: added variable_overrides parameter to read_substrate()/parse_substrate(), so
#              an external caller (e.g. a parametric sweep script) can override a <Variable>'s
#              value without editing the XML file - see variables_list.apply_overrides()
# 18 Aug 2026: made the "variables" argument optional (default None -> empty variables_list)
#              on stackup_material/dielectric_layer/metal_layer/derived_layer/thermal_table,
#              so a caller built before <Variables> existed (e.g. setupEM's stackup_editor.py,
#              which constructs these directly rather than via parse_substrate()) keeps working
#              unchanged for ordinary files, instead of every call raising TypeError outright
# 12 Sep 2026: added a built-in default "AIR" material (Permittivity=1.0, matching the
#              convention already used across example stackup files) so a <Dielectric>/<Layer>
#              can reference Material="AIR" without a <Material Name="AIR"> entry in the file;
#              an explicit user-defined <Material Name="AIR"> still overrides it
# 12 Sep 2026: added the reserved "PEC" material name - Layer Material="PEC" is now valid on
#              conductor/via/sheet layers without any matching <Materials> entry; see
#              get_material_from_layer_or_dielectric_name() in util_simulation_setup.py for
#              where the reserved name is resolved into each solver's ideal-conductor construct
